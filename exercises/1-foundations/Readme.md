## Difficulties Encountered

Had no difficulties with understanding Python code but incredible 
difficulties with understanding Git and GitHub. I did not know how to 
submit a file from a remote GitHub repository and tried to understand how 
to take my file edits from my local repository that I forked from the 
class repo and push it to my main branch. This took a few days to figure 
out. Apologies.
